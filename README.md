# risk_of_si
Using the shiny package, we implemented the model into a website where individuals can calculate predicted risk of SI for patients with advanced malignant tumors. Users input individual's characteristics on the left-side panel, after which total point and predicted risk of SI will be shown on top of the main panel. Users can also manually calculate total points based on nomogram shown on the main panel. To calculate the risk of SI based on the patient characteristics, first determine the point for each predictor by drawing a vertical line from that predictor to the top points scale. Then sum all of the points and draw a vertical line from the total points scale to the risk line to obtain the risk of SI.
